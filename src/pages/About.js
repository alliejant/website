          and to the point: I am a full stack software engineer. I have been
          programming since 2015 when I took a career test and programming came
          up as one of my matched careers. I started learning javascript through{" "}
          <a href="www.codecademy.com" target="blank">
            codecademy
          </a>{" "}
          and gradually moved to more complex topics such as React, GraphQL with
          Relay, and other languages like Go. I’ve worked in front-end,
          back-end, full stack and mobile engineering roles and love all of
          them. Coding in general excites me and how much there is to learn!

          Outside of engineering, I love listening and dancing to salsa, cumbia,
          and electronic music. I met my husband while salsa dancing and got
          married to him recently on the edge of Yosemite. I also love traveling
          and lived in Ecuador for almost a year while working at a non-profit.{" "}

          I’d love to connect with others who are building a mobile application
          or want to talk code together! I will be travelling abroad soon, so if
          you are a recruiter who is looking for remote (ideally part-time)
          employee, please reach out too!
