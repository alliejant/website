          and gradually moved to more complex topics such as React, GraphQL with
          Relay, and other languages like Go, Ruby, and Python. I’ve worked in
          front-end, back-end, and full-stack roles and enjoy both web and
          mobile engineering. Coding in general excites me and how much there is
          to learn!

          Outside of engineering, I like hiking, listening to electronic music,
          and dancing to salsa/cumbia (how I met my husband). Since my last
          position, I took some time to travel the world before settling back in
          to the lovely San Francisco Bay Area.

          I’d love to connect with others who are building a mobile application
          or want to talk code together! I am currently looking for a new
